To run a multipool on nomp is a bit of a pain to say the least. one of the first things needed to do is edit the .json files
in pool_configs and set a very high payment like so.
    "paymentProcessing": {
        "enabled": true,
       "paymentInterval": 75,
        "minimumPayment": 99999999999,
        "daemon": {

so that the shift is paid out by the scripts that are going to be run from this folder. either on a cron or by hand.

next go to your config.json in the base folder. and change the validate worker username to false like so
    "defaultPoolConfigs": {
        "blockRefreshInterval": 1000,
        "jobRebroadcastTimeout": 55,
        "connectionTimeout": 600,
       "emitInvalidBlockHashes": false,
       "validateWorkerUsername": false,

for each of the coins your adding you will have to go to the multipool/bin folder and run
either sharedis <coinname> for sha256 or scryptredis <coinname> for scrypt
this will add each of the coins on the pool into the database for the profit script
and check worker balances. these also have to match the .json file coin names.


line 5 of the file profit will need to be changed to inlcude the proper coin name your paying out in.


./profit will calculate the workers estimated earning based off of the balances they have mined in each coin and set an entry in the database for each.
./payment will clear the workers balance and pay all of the workers from the coindaemon of your choice.



Optional:

Webdis is a web interface for curling redis values from.
To download and install
git clone https://github.com/nicolasff/webdis.git
cd webdis
sudo make clean all
after installed copy webdis.json over to your webdis folder you just cloned
and start with

you will now be able to curl results from your public IP address if you open port 7379 without leaving your database accessible.

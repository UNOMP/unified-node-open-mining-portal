#### Node Open Mining Portal

This portal is an extremely efficient, highly scalable, all-in-one, easy to setup cryptocurrency mining pool written
entirely in Node.js. It contains a stratum poolserver; reward/payment/share processor; and a (*not yet completed*)
responsive user-friendly front-end website featuring mining instructions, in-depth live statistics, and an admin center.

#### Production Usage Notice
This is beta software. All of the following are things that can change and break an existing NOMP setup: functionality of any feature, structure of configuration files and structure of redis data. If you use this software in production then *DO NOT* pull new code straight into production usage because it can and often will break your setup and require you to tweak things like config files or redis data.

### Features

* For the pool server it uses the highly efficient [node-stratum-pool](//github.com/sigwo/node-merged-pool) module which
supports vardiff, POW & POS, transaction messages, anti-DDoS, IP banning, [several hashing algorithms](//github.com/zone117x/node-stratum-pool#hashing-algorithms-supported).

* The portal has an [MPOS](//github.com/MPOS/php-mpos) compatibility mode so that the it can
function as a drop-in-replacement for [python-stratum-mining](//github.com/Crypto-Expert/stratum-mining). This
mode can be enabled in the configuration and will insert shares into a MySQL database in the format which MPOS expects.
For a direct tutorial see the wiki page [Setting up NOMP for MPOS usage](//github.com/zone117x/node-open-mining-portal/wiki/Setting-up-NOMP-for-MPOS-usage).

* Multi-pool ability - this software was built from the ground up to run with multiple coins simultaneously (which can
have different properties and hashing algorithms). It can be used to create a pool for a single coin or for multiple
coins at once. The pools use clustering to load balance across multiple CPU cores.

* For reward/payment processing, shares are inserted into Redis (a fast NoSQL key/value store). The PROP (proportional)
reward system is used with [Redis Transactions](http://redis.io/topics/transactions) for secure and super speedy payouts.
There is zero risk to the pool operator. Shares from rounds resulting in orphaned blocks will be merged into share in the
current round so that each and every share will be rewarded

* This portal does not have user accounts/logins/registrations. Instead, miners simply use their coin address for stratum
authentication. A minimalistic HTML5 front-end connects to the portals statistics API to display stats from from each
pool such as connected miners, network/pool difficulty/hash rate, etc.

* Coin-switching ports using coin-networks and crypto-exchange APIs to detect profitability. Miner's connect to these ports
with their public key which NOMP uses to derive an address for any coin needed to be paid out.


#### Attack Mitigation
* Detects and thwarts socket flooding (garbage data sent over socket in order to consume system resources).
* Detects and thwarts zombie miners (botnet infected computers connecting to your server to use up sockets but not sending any shares).
* Detects and thwarts invalid share attacks:
   * NOMP is not vulnerable to the low difficulty share exploits happening to other pool servers. Other pool server
   software has hardcoded guesstimated max difficulties for new hashing algorithms while NOMP dynamically generates the
   max difficulty for each algorithm based on values founds in coin source code.
   * IP banning feature which on a configurable threshold will ban an IP for a configurable amount of time if the miner
   submits over a configurable threshold of invalid shares.
* NOMP is written in Node.js which uses a single thread (async) to handle connections rather than the overhead of one
thread per connection, and clustering is also implemented so all CPU cores are taken advantage of.


#### Security
NOMP has some implicit security advantages for pool operators and miners:
* Without a registration/login system, non-security-oriented miners reusing passwords across pools is no longer a concern.
* Automated payouts by default and pool profits are sent to another address so pool wallets aren't plump with coins -
giving hackers little reward and keeping your pool from being a target.
* Miners can notice lack of automated payments as a possible early warning sign that an operator is about to run off with their coins.


#### Planned Features

* NOMP API - Used by the website to display stats and information about the pool(s) on the portal's front-end website,
and by the NOMP Desktop app to retrieve a list of available coins (and version-bytes for local wallet/address generation).

* To reduce variance for pools just starting out which have little to no hashing power a feature is planned which will
allow your own pool to connect upstream to a larger pool server. It will request work from the larger pool then
redistribute the work to our own connected miners.

Usage
=====


#### Requirements
* Coin daemon(s) (find the coin's repo and build latest version from source)
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) v0.10+ ([follow these installation instructions](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager))
* [Redis](http://redis.io/) key-value store v2.6+ ([follow these instructions](http://redis.io/topics/quickstart))

##### Seriously
Those are legitimate requirements. If you use old versions of Node.js or Redis that may come with your system package manager then you will have problems. Follow the linked instructions to get the last stable versions.


[**Redis security warning**](http://redis.io/topics/security): be sure firewall access to redis - an easy way is to
include `bind 127.0.0.1` in your `redis.conf` file. Also it's a good idea to learn about and understand software that
you are using - a good place to start with redis is [data persistence](http://redis.io/topics/persistence).

Redis server may require a password, this is done using the requirepass directive in the redis configuration file.
By default config.json contains blank "" - means disabled redis auth, to set any password just put "redispass" in quotes.

#### 0) Setting up coin daemon
Follow the build/install instructions for your coin daemon. Your coin.conf file should end up looking something like this:
```
daemon=1
rpcuser=litecoinrpc
rpcpassword=securepassword
rpcport=19332
```
For redundancy, its recommended to have at least two daemon instances running in case one drops out-of-sync or offline,
all instances will be polled for block/transaction updates and be used for submitting blocks. Creating a backup daemon
involves spawning a daemon using the `-datadir=/backup` command-line argument which creates a new daemon instance with
it's own config directory and coin.conf file. Learn about the daemon, how to use it and how it works if you want to be
a good pool operator. For starters be sure to read:

    "symbol": "ltc",
    "algorithm": "scrypt",

    /* Magic value only required for setting up p2p block notifications. It is found in the daemon
       source code as the pchMessageStart variable.

You can create as many of these pool config files as you want (such as one pool per coin you which to operate).
If you are creating multiple pools, ensure that they have unique stratum ports.

For more information on these configuration options see the [pool module documentation](https://github.com/zone117x/node-stratum-pool#module-usage)



##### [Optional, recommended] Setting up blocknotify
1. In `config.json` set the port and password for `blockNotifyListener`
2. In your daemon conf file set the `blocknotify` command to use:
```
node [path to cli.js] [coin name in config] [block hash symbol]
```
Example: inside `dogecoin.conf` add the line
```
blocknotify=node /home/nomp/scripts/cli.js blocknotify dogecoin %s
```

Alternatively, you can use a more efficient block notify script written in pure C. Build and usage instructions
are commented in [scripts/blocknotify.c](scripts/blocknotify.c).


#### 3) Start the portal

```bash
node init.js
```

###### Optional enhancements for your awesome new mining pool server setup:
* Use something like [forever](https://github.com/nodejitsu/forever) to keep the node script running
in case the master process crashes. 
* Use something like [redis-commander](https://github.com/joeferner/redis-commander) to have a nice GUI
for exploring your redis database.
* Use something like [logrotator](http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2010/07/logrotate-examples/) to rotate log 
output from NOMP.
* Use [New Relic](http://newrelic.com/) to monitor your NOMP instance and server performance.


#### Upgrading NOMP
When updating NOMP to the latest code its important to not only `git pull` the latest from this repo, but to also update
the `node-stratum-pool` and `node-multi-hashing` modules, and any config files that may have been changed.
* Inside your NOMP directory (where the init.js script is) do `git pull` to get the latest NOMP code.
* Remove the dependenices by deleting the `node_modules` directory with `rm -r node_modules`.
* Run `npm update` to force updating/reinstalling of the dependencies.
* Compare your `config.json` and `pool_configs/coin.json` configurations to the latest example ones in this repo or the ones in the setup instructions where each config field is explained. You may need to modify or add any new changes.
